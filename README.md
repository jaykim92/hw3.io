I wasn't able to figure out how to incorporate the prompts and confirms and have it show up in the html, so I ended adding bootstrap elements for text input and check boxes. I also had to do some googling to get code to concatonate different types of string.

## description of the project

Enter in the length of the desired password in the text input field. Check the different boxes depending on preference.
